# neural-network-blob

a simple blob neural network. This simulation replicates the fundamental theories of evolution.
Blobs will survive if they eat, and will further reproduce to create new clones, with mutations.
If the blob does not eat, they will die.
As blobs get more complex behaviours and refine their logic to get better at getting food, they will
become the dominant blob.

This can be seen in the number of blobs that are alive at the end compared to the amount of food.
If there are no food left, that means that they have learnt the ability to find food
If there are alot of dead blobs, it means they are more lucky than learning a strategy to find food
If there are only a few blobs and no food left, that means that they are so efficient at finding food that other blobs did no have time to get food in order to survive.

This basic evolutionary process can become exponentially complex as more input sensors, output actions and inner neurons are added.
